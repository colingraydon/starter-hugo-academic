Technical problem solver. Full stack developer. Hair care enthusiast. When I'm not tinkering with my latest project, you can find me at a concert. I'm currently working for Ascend Meditations to build the backend for a health and wellness app. I'm also currently teaching a course in full-stack development for my university's software engineering club. I'm passionate about the environment and helping animals, so if you're interested in collaborating on a related project, please let me know!
